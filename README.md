## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - For Routing
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For Styles
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - Build Tool
- [Ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons) - For Icons

### What I learned

- Learned the difference between building an SPA and SSR app.
- Learned how to create multi-page applications and implement routing in them.
- Learned how to handle, fetch, load and cache slow APIs through this project since REST countries API is very slow.
- Learned how to have fallback UI's for component failing to render on failed requests.
- Learned how data is used to fetch other data on another page.
- How to use Ionicons.

### Continued development

- Probably be using Next.js to create this project fast.
- Use a popular UI library here (shadcn).
